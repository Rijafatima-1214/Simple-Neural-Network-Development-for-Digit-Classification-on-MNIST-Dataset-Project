# Simple-Neural-Network-Development-for-Digit-Classification-on-MNIST-Dataset-Project
This project builds and trains a simple feed-forward neural network on the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit classification. Two models with different activation functions (ReLU vs Sigmoid) are compared, with training/validation accuracy and loss visualizations to analyze performance differences.
